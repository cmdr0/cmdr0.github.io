# Weaponblack Blog
__Matt Evans__, aka __cmdr0__, aka __uturn__

Note: I don't want to undersell myself, but I'm an enthusiast - perhaps even a professional - but certainly not a blogger.  Many of these write-ups are incomplete, but that's because many of them weren't intended to be write-ups.  They're displays of knowledge/ability, or notes for something I hope to return to.  That being said, the point of publishing them at all is to share my knowledge with others; if you'd like help with something in one of these pages, or you'd like me to elaborate on something I've written, feel free to reach out to me by [creating an issue](https://github.com/cmdr0/cmdr0.github.io/issues).

If you're here for bulletpress, that will be back up momentarily.
